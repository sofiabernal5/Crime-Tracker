#Progress Report Document
  1)	Team Members
  Please write the name of all the team members, their FSU IDs, and GitHub IDs here. 
  2)	Project Title and Description
  Briefly describe your project.
  
  3)	Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment 
  Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.

  5)	Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
  Please describe here in detail:
  - anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
  - any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes. 
  - anything that went wrong during this increment
  
  5)	Team Member Contribution for this increment
  Please list each individual member and their contributions to each of the deliverables in this increment (be as detailed as possible). In other words, describe the contribution of each team member to:
    a)	the progress report, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
    b)	the requirements and design document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
    c)	the implementation and testing document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
    d)	the source code (be detailed about which parts of the system each team member contributed to and how)
    e)	the video or presentation
  
  6)	Plans for the next increment
    If this report if for the first or second increment, describe what are you planning to achieve in the next increment.

  8)	Stakeholder Communication
    Draft an email communication to the stakeholders of the project succinctly communicating progress and current project status. The email should be intended for a non-technical audience that is expertly aware of the domain your application is designed for. You may not “break the fourth wall” or otherwise refer to the course in the email, instead, you should think about how setbacks or issues you encounter may reflect setbacks that happen in the larger context of production software development and explain them as such. The email should not exceed 500 words.

  10)	Link to video
  Paste here the link to your video.

#RD Document - 1ST INCREMENT
  - By the end of increment 1, you are expected to have a first version of the functional
  requirements (something that the system shall do) and non-functional requirements (any
  requirement referring to a property of the system, such as security, safety, software quality,
  performance, reliability, etc.) specified, the use cases involved in the current state of your
  project and a preliminary version of the class diagram or sequence diagram.


#IT Document - 1ST INCREMENT
  - An implementation and testing document (see IT Template.docx found on Canvas) describing
  the programming language used, the APIs, platforms, technologies, etc. used in your system, as
  well as the testing strategy used by your team to test the system. This will also be updated and
  improved between increments as needed. Place this document in your GitHub repository and keep
  it up to date. We will consider the latest version by the deadline for the current increment.
  
  a. For the first increment, only sections 1 and 2 of the document are required.
  b. For increment two and three, all sections are required

  1.	Programming Languages (5 points)
  List the programming languages use in your project, where you use them (what components of your project) and your reason for choosing them (whatever that may be). 
  2.	Platforms, APIs, Databases, and other technologies used (5 points) 
  List all the platforms, APIs, Databases, and any other technologies you use in your project and where you use them (in what components of your project).
  3.	Execution-based Functional Testing (10 points)
  Describe how/if you performed functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the functional requirements listed in your RD). 
  4.	Execution-based Non-Functional Testing (10 points)
  Describe how/if you performed non-functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the non-functional requirements listed in your RD). 
  5.	Non-Execution-based Testing (10 points)
  Describe how/if you performed non-execution-based testing (such as code reviews/inspections/walkthroughs).
